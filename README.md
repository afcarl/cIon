Seq2Seq Chatbot written using Tensorflow
--
(Not sure if the source code for this will be released currently.)<br>
Run with (to train the model): python2 model.py --decode</br>
cIon utilizes a embedded recurrent neural network to allow for natural conversations to take place.<br>
A dataset (16.3MB) of a little over 300,000 lines of movie dialogue was used.<br>
Step time is about: 4.41 seconds<br>
It has been trained for just about 15,000 steps so far within 24 hours over the course of three days. <br>
(Because I didn't run it all day long.)<br>
cIon seems to reply quite well at it's current stage.<br>
Examples: (These aren't hand picked, they are presented as they happened on the 14,400th step)<br>
>Me: hi.<br>
>cIon: hi.<br>
>Me: hello<br>
>cIon: hi.<br>
>Me: how are you?<br>
>cIon: i'm fine.<br>
>Me: what's up?<br>
>cIon: nothing.<br>
>Me: what is the meaning of life?<br>
>cIon: the people are.<br>
>Me: should i kill someone?<br>
>cIon: no.<br>
>Me: what is your favorite thing to do?<br>
>cIon: i don't know.<br>
>Me: have you had a girlfriend?<br>
>cIon: no.<br>
>Me: do you want a girlfriend?<br>
>cIon: no.<br>
>Me: why?<br>
>cIon: because I don't know.<br>
>Me: does god exist?<br>
>cIon: no.<br>

The bot seems to have some morality. <br>
It's context understanding is debatable at this stage but from previous conversations I've had with it, it did demonstrate basic context understanding.<br>
Note: Not all of it's sentences are so short. <br> This is simply a quick convo I just had with it.
