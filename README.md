Seq2Seq Chatbot written using Tensorflow
--
(Not sure if the source code for this will be released currently.)
cIon utilizes a embedded recurrent neural network to allow for natural conversations to take place.
A dataset (16.3MB) of a little over 300,000 lines of movie dialogue was used.
Step time is about: 4.41 seconds
It has been trained for just about 15,000 steps so far within 24 hours over the course of three days. 
(Because I didn't run it all day long.)
cIon seems to reply quite well at it's current stage.
Examples: (These aren't hand picked, they are presented as they happened on the 14,400th step)
>Me: hi.
>cIon: hi.
>Me: hello
>cIon: hi.
>Me: how are you?
>cIon: i'm fine.
>Me: what's up?
>cIon: nothing.
>Me: what is the meaning of life?
>cIon: the people are.
>Me: should i kill someone?
>cIon: no.
>Me: what is your favorite thing to do?
>cIon: i don't know.
>Me: have you had a girlfriend?
>cIon: no.
>Me: do you want a girlfriend?
>cIon: no.
>Me: why?
>cIon: because I don't know.
>Me: does god exist?
>cIon: no.
The bot seems to have some morality. Not all of it's sentences are so short. This is simply a quick convo I just had with it.
